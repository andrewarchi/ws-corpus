# Contributing to the Whitespace Corpus

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the Whitespace Corpus to ensure
comprehensive, accurate information on the Whitespace language.

## Help wanted

### Documenting new projects

Do you know of any Whitespace projects that are not listed? If so, [file an
issue](https://github.com/wspace/corpus/issues) and I'll make sure to add it.

### Building remaining projects

The current status of building and running each project is documented in
[building.md](./building.md).
